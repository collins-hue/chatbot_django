# Step 1: Fine-Tuning the Model 
If you want your chatbot to be more specific to your domain, you might consider fine-tuning a pre-trained model on your custom dataset. This involves more advanced machine learning techniques and is beyond the scope of this basic guide.

Prepare Your Dataset: Collect and preprocess the conversational data relevant to your domain.

The dataset can be further expanded based on more detailed aspects of specific interests.

# Fine-Tune the Model:

Use the transformers library to fine-tune a conversational model on your dataset.

 Run this script from the command line to fine-tune your model:

 ```sh
python fine_tune_gpt2.py
```

# Step 2: Run Your Django Server and Test the Chatbot

Run Migrations:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Start the Development Server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
